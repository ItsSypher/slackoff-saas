This is SlackOff - the world's worst team communication SaaS designed to be maximally frustrating and hilariously terrible. 

Key principles for this project:
- Implement anti-patterns and dark UX designs
- Make everything as confusing and annoying as possible
- Focus on creating the most frustrating user experience
- Use terrible design decisions like moving buttons, reverse message order, auto-translations, and maximum chaos
- All features should be the opposite of what users actually want

The goal is to create a parody of team communication software that demonstrates every possible way to make software terrible.
